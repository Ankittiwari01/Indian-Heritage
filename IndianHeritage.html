        <p>India is a land of rich and diverse cultures, with a history that
            spans thousands of years. From its ancient civilization and traditions,
            to its modern-day cosmopolitan lifestyle, India's
            culture is a unique blend of different influences and customs.
            One of the most important aspects of Indian culture is its religion.
            Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism are some of the major religions
            that originated in India, and each has a significant impact on the country's beliefs, customs, and way of
            life.
            For example, Hinduism is deeply rooted in the daily life of Indians,
            and its beliefs and practices can be seen in everything from the food people eat to the festivals they
            celebrate.
        </p>
        <p>Another important aspect of Indian culture is its cuisine. India is known for its
            flavorful and aromatic dishes, which are a fusion of different spices, herbs, and cooking styles.
            From the spicy and tangy flavors of the north to the mild and coconut-based dishes of the south,
            each region of India has its own unique culinary traditions.

            Arts and literature have also played a significant role in Indian culture.
            From ancient epics like the Ramayana and the Mahabharata to modern-day Bollywood films,
            Indian storytelling has captivated audiences for centuries. In addition, Indian classical dance forms,
            such as Bharatanatyam and Kathak, are a celebration of the country's rich cultural
            heritage and are enjoyed by people all over the world.

    <h2 id="reli">RELIGIOUS CULTURE</h2>
    <p>
        Religion plays a central role in the culture of India, with a history that stretches back thousands of years.
        India is known for being a land of religious diversity, with four major religions having originated in the
        country: Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism.

        Hinduism is the oldest religion in India, and it is estimated that about 80% of the population practices this
        religion. Hinduism is based on the belief in reincarnation, the idea that after death, the soul is reborn into
        another body. It also places a strong emphasis on the pursuit of enlightenment and the practice of yoga and
        meditation.

        Buddhism, which originated in India around 500 BCE, is based on the teachings of the Buddha and emphasizes the
        importance of self-enlightenment and the elimination of suffering. Buddhism spread from India to other parts of
        Asia, and today there are millions of Buddhists around the world.

            <h4>2.HOLI</h4>
            <p>Holi is one of the major festivals of Hindus. It is celebrated in South Asian countries, especially in
                India and Nepal. Hiranyanaksap wanted to kill his son, so he called his sister, Holika. She had a magic
                robe. This robe had the power to save the wearer from burning in fire. Hiranyakashyap ordered his sister
                to sit on a burning fire along with Prahlad. He thought that his sister would not be harmed by the fire
                of the magic robe and Prahlad would be burnt to death. But the result was the opposite of what the evil
                demon king planned.

                Thus Prahlad came out of the burning fire safely and Holika was burnt to death. Holi is the festival of
                colours. It is celebrated with colors to mark the victory of virtue and goodness over evil.

                The festival is celebrated for two days. The 2nd day, Rang Panchami marks the closing day of the Holi
                festival.

                People are seen with different varieties of colors on Holi. They put colors on each other, sing, dance.
                They worship Lord Krishna and put colors on his idol.</p>
